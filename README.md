# MusicVision
An ASP.NET MVC web application for visualization of Spotify tracks.

The key features of our project are as follows:

- Allow users to browse their Spotify playlists (after logging in with Spotify credentials).
- Allow users to play their Spotify playlists (shuffle, in order, etc), or search for a specific song.
- Algorithmically select a matching video to play along with the song using metadata provided by Spotify.
- Apply live visual effects to the streaming YouTube video in time with music, based on metadata.
